This project is a Taxi Service Application that simulates a complete ride-hailing platform with three user roles: Administrator, User, and Driver. 
The system supports user registration (classic and social network login), profile management, ride requests, driver verification, and ride tracking. Users can request rides, view prices, and track driver arrival times. 
Drivers can view and accept ride requests, track rides, and receive ratings. 
Administrators manage user verification, oversee rides, and control driver access. 
The application includes real-time countdowns, email notifications, and a dashboard tailored to each user role.
